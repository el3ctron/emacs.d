This is my personal .emacs.d configuration.  Feel free to clone it or

I've structured this as Phil Hagelberg did in the "Emacs Starter Kit"
(http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit).  I've stolen ideas
and code from many people on http://www.emacswiki.org/ and elsewhere.
I've tried to include attribution wherever I remember the origin of
stuff, but apologize in advance if I've missed someone.

The 'dss' prefix stands for 'Damn Simple Solutions', my
company name.
